# simulate_and_recover
The goal of the simulate and recover program is to improve parameter recovery as sample size increases while reducing squared error drift rates. We use forward EZ equations in order to give summary statistics in terms of the parameters, inverse EZ equations to give parameters in terms of summary statistics, and sampling distribution equations in order to test how well EZ diffusion can recover its own parameters.
